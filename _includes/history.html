				<h2>Software Engineer @ Priocept</h2>
				<p>Priocept is a small company who provides technical consultancy, project management and software for its clients.
				   My role during these eight months has been not just focused on code development using Java, FTL, HTML5 and CSS3
				   but I had the chance to enhance my skills over technical analysis, estimations, document writing/review, client facing.
				   On top of this I had the chance to learn a lot since I had the opportunity to tune the companies performances over a 
				   wide variety of tasks (deploy on Linux platform, TeamCity configuration and so on).
