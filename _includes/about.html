		<p>Born in Naples in 1989, I started programming at High School when I was 16 years old. After High School I started 
		   University in the attempt of taking a Computer Science degree. After 1 year and half despite good results I decided to 
		   try a more practical approach. For this reason I joined K-Makers S.r.l. in 2009 to attend a training course in Java and 
		   related technologies. Since then, I never stopped programming. After 5 years working in Italian IT Industry, I decided to
		   move to London looking for new challenges and opportunities of growth. Since July 2014 I'm part of the "British System" 
		   and the plan is to continue to keep going until it's possible.
		   <br />
		   I'm very passionate in coding and learning new technologies. Despite this I like to enjoy my friends, my fianc√® and sport activities.</p>
