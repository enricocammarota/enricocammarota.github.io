		<p> Born in Naples in 1989, I started programming at High School when I was 16. After 2 years spent in studying
			various technologies (with a particular focus on OOP) I decided to join K-Makers S.r.l. and in 2009 to
			attend a training course in Java and related technologies. Since then, I have never stopped programming.
			After 5 years of working in Italian IT Industry, I moved to London looking for new challenges and opportunities
			of growth.
			<br /><br />
			After changing two companies I decided to join 7digital and since July 2016 I'm part of the Interactive
			Radio Team based in London Moorgate's offices.
			<!--Since July 2014 I have had the opportunity to learn and grow in two British
		    companies but the plan nowadays is to find the definitive company where I'll be able to settle and create my future.-->
			<br /><br />
			I'm very passionate about coding and learning new technologies but, aside from I also enjoy spending time with my
			friends, attending concerts and events, playing sports and salsa.
