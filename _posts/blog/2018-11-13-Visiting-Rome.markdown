<h3>Visiting Rome</h3>

![Rome Landscape](https://brightcove04pmdo-a.akamaihd.net/5104226627001/5104226627001_5232386545001_5215063851001-vs.jpg?pubId=5104226627001&videoId=5215063851001 "Rome Landscape")

As per Naples during my years in London I received many requests from the locals about the "Eternal City". Rome. <br>

I had the chance to live four years in this city while I was at the beginning of my career and every time I go there something 
of its monuments and atmosphere, immediately captures my attention. It's probably hard to explain and impossible to understand 
but if you'll ever have the chance, try in the night maybe during winter and in the middle of the week to focus on the Coliseum.

With a bit of imagination you'll still be able to listen for the gladiators, the people, the scream and shouts that were the heart
of this city together with the nearest "Foro Romano".

Today, I consider Rome my second home and this is the reason why I decided to write a quick guide (although this is VERY quick
compared to the one for Naples), that will help you moving the first steps in this city. I'll drive you through 3 main sections:

+ What to see - cultural and non-cultural
+ What to eat
+ Fun and interesting activities


<h4>What to see:</h4>

Rome, founded according to tradition on the 21st April 753 B.C. has been the first metropolitan city of humanity. In over 
3 millennia of history, it influenced the world with architecture, philosophy, religion, language and can be considered 
as the seed from where the modern world is born.

Due to its great past, nowadays it is still possible to admire what has been left by over 3000 years of history and magnificence. 
So here they come, all the monuments you would fancy to visit during your holidays ​​in Rome:

<h4>What to eat:</h4>

Even if I spent 4 years in Rome I quite rarely enjoyed a dinner out with my friends. For traditional dishes it's better 
to visit a local "trattoria" rather than very famous/turistic restaurants. Anyway these are the traditional Roman dishes 
I'd like to recommend:


|Name	                    | What	                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Spaghetti alla Carbonara	| Spaghetti, guanciale (special type of ham), garlic, oil, eggs, parmigiano and black pepper. |

<h4>Fun and clubbing</h4>

Basically the city is alive on the week end and in particular on Friday and Saturday night. Even if the nightlife can't 
be compared to the London ones, it's still possible to have good night outs with your friends:

**Drinking spots:**

1. Via del porto fluviale
2. San Giovanni - the entire area is surrounded by drinking spots
3. Gianicolo - there's an amazing terrace from where you can get a great view of the city
4. Campo de' Fiori - wide selection of wine bar and cocktail bars
5. Ponte Milvio - wide selection of wine bar and cocktail bars
6. DoppioZerOO - ideal for a proper Apericena (aperitif + dinner) for just 10 euros you could get bottomless food and 1 cocktail. Definitely recommended. Needs reservation though.
7. Piazza Trilussa - wide selection of wine bar and cocktail bars
8. Testaccio - wide selection of restaurants, wine bar and cocktail bars

**Clubbing:**

1. Art Cafe'
2. Gay Village
3. Goa Club
4. Project Roma
5. Spazio 900
6. Fiesta
